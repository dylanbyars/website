# For Development

Install `browser-sync`

```bash
npm install -g browser-sync
```

run the `preview` script that I have in my `.zshrc`

# TODO:
- figure out if I want tailwind at the base of the project or not. probably not. then I need to hand style the homepage because I still like that style
- what's the difference between a `/public` dir and a `build` dir?
